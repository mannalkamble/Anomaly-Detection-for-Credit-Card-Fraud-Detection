# Anomaly Detection for Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the final project code for the course ECE-GY 7123 Deep Learning at New York University. This project aims to replicate and validate the deep learning-based anomaly detection model for credit card fraud detection as presented in the paper by Tung-Yu Wu and You-Ting Wang.

## How to Run
1. **Download the Dataset**: 
   Obtain the dataset from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Download and place it in a preferred location within the project directory.

2. **Update Dataset Path in the Notebook**: 
   Change the dataset path in `Project_Main.ipynb` to the location where you have stored the dataset.

3. **Run the Notebook**: 
   Open and run the cells of `Project_Main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to observe the project's implementation and results.
