# Experimental Section

## Overview
This section contains experimental files aimed at exploring various aspects of machine learning, distinct from the primary anomaly detection project.

## Files Description

### 1. `Adversarial_Attacks.ipynb`
A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the study of adversarial attacks on machine learning models, providing insights into model vulnerabilities and defense strategies.

### 2. `dataset 2.csv`
This dataset is specifically used in conjunction with `Testing_on_Cerebral_Palsy_Inbalanced_Dataset.ipynb`. It offers a unique set of data points for testing the model's performance on medical data, particularly focusing on cerebral palsy.

### 3. `Testing_on_Cerebral_Palsy_Inbalanced_Dataset.ipynb`
A notebook that employs `dataset 2.csv` to evaluate the anomaly detection model's effectiveness on an imbalanced medical dataset, highlighting its applicability in healthcare scenarios.

## Usage
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Run `Adversarial_Attacks.ipynb` to experiment with model security against adversarial attacks.
- **Cerebral Palsy Dataset Analysis**: Use `Testing_on_Cerebral_Palsy_Inbalanced_Dataset.ipynb` in conjunction with `dataset 2.csv` to study the model's performance on imbalanced medical data.
